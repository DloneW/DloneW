## Hi, I’m Dlone 👋

I’m a full-stack developer in progress, focused on building
strong fundamentals through real, hands-on projects.

### Current Focus
- Frontend foundations (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Backend fundamentals (learning Node.js next)
- Writing clean, readable code

### What I’m Building
- Small frontend components and layouts
- JavaScript logic and DOM interactions
- Projects that connect frontend to backend

### How I Work
- One concept at a time
- Consistent daily commits
- Refactoring instead of rushing

### Long-Term Goal
To become a well-rounded full-stack developer capable of
building complete, production-ready applications.## Hi there 👋
